# RouteCraft

RouteCraft is a C++ software project designed to visualize and optimize travel routes between multiple locations using the Dijkstra algorithm. It provides an interactive map interface where users can add, delete, and manage locations, as well as customize routes with stops.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Displays a graphical representation of locations with the ability to select start and destination points.
- **Route Optimization:** Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between locations based on user input.
- **Animation:** Shows a bus animation traversing the calculated route, enhancing user experience.
- **Location Management:** Allows users to add new locations dynamically and delete existing ones as needed.
- **Route Customization:** Enables users to add stops along the route to accommodate specific travel needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Library:** graphics.h (for graphical interface)
- **Algorithm:** Dijkstra's algorithm (for route optimization)

## Usage

To use RouteCraft, compile and run the program in a C++ environment that supports graphics.h library.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler with graphics.h support.
3. Run the executable to launch the application.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to interact with the map, add locations, and optimize routes.
